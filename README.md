The client is Artemis Financial who is a consulting company whose main focus is in the financial sector which involves savings, retirement
investments and insurance. They want to innovate its operations by improving security features of their public web interface.

In terms of security vulnerabilities, it is important to test first the system by deploying attacks and see how the system responds. 
Having code security makes it more secure by the way of input validation. These security features should be of utmost importance
considering the client is handling people's financial assets.

The challenging part is identifying the most vulnerable areas of the system. This can only be done by knowing all aspects of the systems.

In adding more layers of security is with the use of more input validation and multi factor authentication. This is important to properly 
validate access to those who have the proper credentials. 

This would be done by properly and routinely checking the code for error and refactoring. Also with outside party validation to audit 
the system for any vulnerabilities. 

Any resources for any current trends for ensuring security features are updated to date. Software vulnerability tools and error search tools are 
vital to help ensure a more secure system.

I would show them that i am persistent in having my system secure and if any vulnerabilities are found, I would ensure to work on it as soon as possible.
